rpm2php can run in two modes: The browser mode, the admin mode

For both modes, the file
   rpm2php/system/application/config/config.php

needs to be configured.

1- The browser mode, for public network:

The files 
   rpm2php/login.php \
   rpm2php/logout.php \
   rpm2php/response.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/controllers/act.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/controllers/queue.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/controllers/updatedb.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/views/application/act.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/views/application/queue.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/views/application/updatedb.php \
   rpm2php/system/application/views/application/webshell.php

need to be removed from the public directory. 

2- One needs to crate an .htaccess file. See htaccess-example file.
An .htpasswd file needs to be created with 
   user: log password: out
by
   $ htpasswd -c .htpasswd log
Since there is no actualy logging out from apache authentication,
we fake logging out by logging in as this user.

Finally, symlinks to
   /usr/bin/movepackage
   /usr/bin/pullpackage
   /usr/bin/pushpackage
   /usr/bin/populate-rpmfind-db
in webtools' webbin dir
   /usr/lib64/webtools/webbin/
to enable managing publish scripts through web interface.
