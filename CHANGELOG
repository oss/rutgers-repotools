    - complete rehaul of the entire directory structure
    - changes to the config file (rutgers-repotools.cfg):
      + one universal config file, instead of one for each CentOS release
      + CentOS release "distver" removed from the config file
      + added "alldistvers" to "repositories"
      + did some cleanup and published a sample config in the public Git repo
      + changed section "rpm2phpdb" to "rpmdb"
      + added "backupdir" to "rpmdb"
    - only one wrapper for each script, instead of one for each version of
      CentOS
    - pushpackage, pullpackage, movepackage now take Koji-style repository
      arguments (e.g. centos6-rutgers-testing)
    - rebuildrepos can now rebuild repositories for multiple versions of CentOS
      in one invocation
    - movepackage has the ability to move a package from CentOS 5 to 6, etc.
    - fixed a bug where pushing or pulling a CentOS 5 package would mess with
      things that are CentOS 6 and vice-versa
    - updated the cron scripts to reflect the new usage
    - updated the spec file; modified the descriptions of certain things and
      removed sensitive information from the post-install
    - renamed cron job scripts to a consistent naming and moved them into the
      script directory instead of the cron directory
    - checkrepo.py has been rewritten: new name is checkdep.py
      + uses argparse
      + is fairly independent; could probably be rewritten into the mail library
        at some point in the future
      + does not check the unstable repository unless passed "--check-unstable"
        as an option on the command line
    - daily_checks has been rewritten as a Python script
      + does four things: backs up Koji, backs up the rpm database, checks the
        repository structure, and does dependency checking
      + all these cron scripts now take values from the configuration file
        instead of being hard-coded in
    - included a sample depcheck.ignore and sample configuration file
    - documentation in the README has been updated
    - moved scripts from cron folder to bin folder (only daily_checks is left in
      the cron folder)

        packages to the rutgers-debuginfo repo.
